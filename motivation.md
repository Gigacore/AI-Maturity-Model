## Motivation

The AI Maturity Model for Software Engineering Teams was developed to address the growing need for structured, responsible, and role-aware AI adoption within software development organizations. While AI tools are rapidly advancing, many teams lack a clear roadmap to evolve from ad hoc usage to scalable, strategic integration. This model fills that gap.

### 1. Bridging the Gap Between Experimentation and Strategy

Most engineering teams begin their AI journey with isolated experimentation—developers trying out tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT without process, standards, or support. This model helps teams move from informal exploration to structured, consistent, and ultimately transformational AI use across the SDLC.

### 2. Grounding AI Adoption in Engineering Practice

Existing AI maturity frameworks often focus on enterprise-level capabilities, leaving a gap at the team and individual engineer level. This model is tailored specifically to software engineering contexts—integrating AI literacy, tooling, workflows, and role expectations. It maps maturity onto what engineers actually do every day.

### 3. Enabling Role-Based Growth

AI adoption should evolve alongside career growth. Junior engineers need foundational prompting and evaluation skills, while senior and staff engineers are expected to mentor, shape workflows, and lead responsible integration. This model supports skill progression and leadership development through clear, role-aligned expectations.

### 4. Embedding Responsibility and Governance

As AI adoption increases, so do risks around trust, misuse, and safety. The model explicitly includes Trust, Safety & Governance as a core dimension, encouraging teams to mature not just in technical capability but in ethical responsibility, auditability, and secure design.

### 5. Aligning AI Use With Strategic and Business Impact

The model helps organizations link technical AI adoption to measurable business outcomes—such as faster delivery, improved quality, or new product capabilities. By introducing maturity levels and dimensions, teams can benchmark progress, guide retrospectives, and align AI investment with long-term value.
