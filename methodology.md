# Methodology

The AI Maturity Model for Software Engineering is built on a synthesis of academic research, industry practice, and foundational systems-thinking frameworks. It defines how software teams and roles evolve in their adoption of AI—progressing from isolated experimentation to organization-wide transformation.

## Research-Informed Structure

The model is grounded in a wide range of peer-reviewed research, industry reports, and practitioner studies (see "Research Synthesis"). Key sources include:

* Studies on developer productivity and AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, pair programming with LLMs)
* Research on responsible AI governance, trust calibration, and human-AI interaction
* Empirical findings on prompt engineering, code quality, workflow automation, and SDLC integration

These insights shape the definitions of behaviors, capabilities, and risks within each maturity level and dimension.

## Role-Aware Design

Rather than framing AI maturity solely at the organizational level, the model embeds progression within the software engineering career ladder—from Junior Engineer to Distinguished Engineer. This enables:

* **Clarity for individuals**: Clear expectations for development, leadership, and AI engagement at each level
* **Alignment for teams**: Visibility into how capabilities scale across roles
* **Scalability across contexts**: Role-based maturity that adapts to team size, domain, and organization type

## Foundations in Proven Frameworks

While the AI Maturity Model is grounded in contemporary research and software engineering practice, it is also inspired by foundational systems-thinking models such as CMMI, Six Sigma, and the Toyota Production System (TPS). These frameworks inform the model’s emphasis on structured capability growth, continuous improvement, cross-functional feedback loops, and role-aware responsibility. Like CMMI, it defines staged maturity across organizational and technical behaviors. It echoes Six Sigma’s focus on quality, governance, and measurement. And it reflects TPS principles through its integration of flow, trust, and human-AI collaboration across evolving workflows.
