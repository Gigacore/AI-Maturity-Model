# **AI Maturity Model for Software Engineering Teams**

As AI becomes embedded in mainstream development, engineering teams face rising challenges: **large number of codebases now include AI-generated code**, yet many teams lack structured governance frameworks, skill alignment, or clarity on responsible adoption. Tooling is racing ahead, but maturity varies wildly—creating risks around **maintainability, trust, and innovation**.

The **AI Maturity Model for Software Engineering Teams (AI-MM SET)** is a structured framework designed to help software engineering teams and individuals assess, align, and evolve their adoption of artificial intelligence. It describes how teams transition from early, unstructured experimentation to strategic and ultimately transformative use of AI across engineering workflows, development tools, and organizational culture.

Structured as a three-axis maturity matrix, this model outlines:

* **Five Maturity Levels** – From Exploratory (Level 1) to Transformational (Level 5), showing increasing sophistication, integration, and impact of AI.
* **Six Core Dimensions** – Capturing how capabilities grow across skills, processes, platforms, governance, collaboration, and outcomes.
* **Role-Based Progression** – Describing how expectations evolve from Junior Engineer to Distinguished Engineer, with growing responsibilities for integration, mentorship, and innovation.

## Maturity Levels

| Level                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Exploratory**      | AI usage is unstructured and highly variable across the team. Some developers experiment out of curiosity, while others may lack awareness. There are no shared practices, no oversight, and no influence from senior roles. Teamwide adoption is absent.             |
| **2. Applied**          | AI tools are introduced through pilots or individual initiative. Engineers begin using AI for specific tasks, gaining experience with tools and prompting. Teams share emerging practices, but adoption is inconsistent and depends on personal interest.             |
| **3. Standardized**     | AI usage becomes consistent across teams and roles. Engineers show fluency, peer review processes evolve to include AI outputs, and senior contributors mentor others. Tools are integrated into workflows, and governance policies are introduced and enforced.      |
| **4. Strategic**        | AI is embedded across the entire software lifecycle and aligned with team and business strategy. Engineers design AI-first workflows, collaborate across roles, and lead scalable integration. Governance and performance measurement are proactive and structured.   |
| **5. Transformational** | AI is deeply embedded in culture, architecture, and day-to-day engineering. Engineers and AI systems operate as collaborative peers. Roles evolve to supervise, orchestrate, and co-create with AI. Innovation is continuous, and AI differentiates the organization. |

## Core Dimensions

The AI Maturity Model evaluates progress across six critical dimensions that define responsible, effective, and high-impact AI adoption in software engineering:

| Dimension                        | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI Literacy & Competency**     | Developer fluency with AI tools, prompt engineering, critical evaluation, and peer mentorship.  |
| **Workflow & SDLC Integration**  | Integration of AI across all stages of the software development lifecycle.                      |
| **Tooling Integration**          | Embedding AI into developer environments, CI/CD, and scalable internal platforms.               |
| **Trust, Safety & Governance**   | Secure, fair, and transparent use of AI with enforceable policies and oversight.                |
| **AI-Augmented Collaboration**   | Practices for human-AI teaming, review workflows, and trust calibration.                        |
| **Business Impact & Innovation** | AI’s role in accelerating delivery, enabling innovation, and driving measurable business value. |
