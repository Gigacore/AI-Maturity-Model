# Contributing to the AI Maturity Model for Software Engineering Teams

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This AI Maturity Model is designed to help software engineering teams assess and evolve their AI adoption practices across roles, workflows, and strategic goals. It is built on rigorous research, cross-referenced with established frameworks, and grounded in engineering career progression.

Your contributions are essential to improving the model’s clarity, relevance, and usability.

## What You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

### Content Improvements

* Refine definitions or maturity level descriptors
* Suggest clarifications to existing role- or dimension-based guidance
* Add concrete examples to illustrate maturity behaviors
* Identify inconsistencies across levels, roles, or dimensions

### Research-Backed Enhancements

* Propose new research studies
* Suggest empirical evidence supporting or challenging specific claims
* Submit benchmarking data or metrics used in practice

### Role-Specific Contributions

* Suggest refinements to how maturity expectations align with specific software engineering roles
* Propose detailed role behavior for new or emerging roles (e.g., ML Engineer, DevSecOps)

### Methodology Feedback

* Provide suggestions to improve the research synthesis or structure outlined in [`methodology.md`](./methodology.md)
* Offer critiques or ideas to improve validity, transparency, or adoption

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Start with an Issue or Discussion**

   * Open an issue  to describe the change you want to make.
   * Reference the dimension, role, or maturity level you are targeting.

2. **Keep it Role- and Dimension-Aware**

   * Align suggestions with the three-axis model:

     * **Level:** Exploratory → Transformational
     * **Dimension:** One of six (e.g., AI Literacy & Competency, Workflow Integration, etc.)
     * **Role:** From Junior to Distinguished Engineer

3. **Support with Evidence**

   * Whenever possible, cite credible sources—preferably empirical studies.
   * If submitting anecdotal insights, flag them clearly as “Practitioner Insight.”

4. **Maintain Clarity and Consistency**

   * Follow the tone and structure of the existing model.
   * Use concise, actionable language—avoid jargon unless defined.

5. **Acknowledge Scope**

   * The model is primarily for technical individual contributor (IC) roles—not engineering management tracks.
   * Mentoring, leadership, and strategic responsibility should be embedded within existing dimensions.
